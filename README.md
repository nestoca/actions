# actions

These are nesto's standard and reusable GitHub Actions to be used in the various CI workflows of our projects.

Note: This is a **public** git repo! Please ensure that no secret or sensitive internal
information gets committed to it. If you need to make changes to these actions,
please submit a PR that will be reviewed and merged by the DevOps team.

That notwithstanding, dev teams have full freedom and flexibility in how they use these
actions in the workflows of their own projects, because those are stored in private git
repos.
